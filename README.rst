Overview
========

The ServiceNowRac package provides a python REST API client for communicating
with a ServiceNow instance. The package contains the following classes:

- SnowClient - This class is used to create a persistent client connection to a
  ServiceNow instance.  It provides the underlying reliable connection and
  defines the get and post methods for interacting with ServiceNow REST API.

- SnowTable - Use this class to perform operations on existing tables. Provides
  the API calls for table operations.

Requirements
------------

-  Tables in the ServiceNow instance need to allow web access for the
   user.
-  Currently has only be tested on Centos7, should work on most Unix
   systems.

Installation
============

- From pip (recommended): ``$ pip install ServiceNowRac``

- From source: ``$ pip install git+https://github.com/aristanetworks/ServiceNowRac.git``

Getting Started
===============

Once the package has been installed you can run the following example to
verify that everything has been installed properly.

Example
-------

Creating a connection to a ServiceNow instance and creating a record in
the change\_request table.

::

    from ServiceNowRac.snow_client import SnowClient
    from ServiceNowRac.snow_table import SnowTable

    # ServiceNow Instance information
    hostname = 'service_now_instance_hostname'
    username = 'service_now_username'
    password = 'service_now_password'

    # Connect to Service Now
    snow_server = SnowClient(hostname, username, password)
    snow_chg_reqs = SnowTable('change_request', snow_server)

    # Create the change request dict
    data = {
        'approval'           : 'requested',
        'assigned_to'        : username,
        'category'           : 'Hardware',
        'comments'           : 'Created a change request',
        'description'        : 'Created a change request description',
        'impact'             : '3',
        'priority'           : '3',
        'reason'             : 'Network Requirements',
        'requested_by'       : username,
        'type'               : 'Routine',
    }
    records = snow_chg_reqs.insert(data)
    assert len(records) == 1

    # Verify that the change request record that prints out below was created
    # on your ServiceNow instance.
    print records[0]

Testing
=======

Both system and unit tests are provided.

Unit Test
---------

Unit tests can be executed via:

.. code:: sh

    $ make unittest

System Test
-----------

In order for system tests to be run, a valid ServiceNow instance along with
login credentials is needed and test/system/config.py should be updated with
instance/login. Once updated, system tests can be run by issuing:

.. code:: sh

    $ make systest

Coverage
========

Contributions should maintain at the minimum +90% code coverage. You can check
this locally before submitting your Pull Request.

- Run ``make unittest``
- Run ``make coverage_report`` to confirm code coverage.
